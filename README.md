# Real_time_Face_Recognition
A real-time face recognition system is built using OpenCV, Haarcascade attributes and K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm.
The Face_Data_Collection.ipynb collects face samples and stores them inside Face_Data folder.
Face_Recognition_Using_KNN.ipynb captures real-time images from the webcam and generates a caption displaying name of the person and recognises person using KNN algorithm.
